"""
Measure shape classification.

The *shape* of a measure — scalar, 1-D series, 2-D matrix — is the single
input that decides which plot kinds are even meaningful for it (see
``capability.available_plots``). Classification is deliberately based on
**observed values**, not on declared dtypes or SQL type-name strings: a pandas
object column holding numpy arrays and a DuckDB LIST column both arrive here
as "a cell that contains a sequence", and the value is the only reliable
common ground. (The GUI's pre-existing ``_numeric_plot_kind`` in
``scistack_gui/api/variables.py`` made the same call for the same reason.)
