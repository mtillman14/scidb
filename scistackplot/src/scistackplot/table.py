"""
``LongTable`` — a long-format DataFrame plus the column roles a plot needs.

Every source (CSV, DataFrame, scidb) hands the rest of the package one of
these. It answers three questions the raw DataFrame cannot: which columns are
*factors* (categorical things you can slice by), which are *measures* (the
numbers being plotted), and — critically — **what order each factor's levels
go in**.

That last one is not cosmetic. Schema keys like ``"01"`` are strings by project
rule, and pandas' default lexicographic ordering renders them as
``"1", "10", "2"`` on a categorical axis: visibly wrong, and wrong in a way
that looks like a data problem rather than a plotting problem. Sources that
know better (scidb knows its declared ``schema_key_types``) supply
``level_order`` explicitly; everything else falls back to the natural-sort
heuristic below.
