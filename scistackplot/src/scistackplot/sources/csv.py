"""
CSV source — the standalone entry point, and the direct descendant of the
R/Shiny proof of concept.

Its factor/measure split follows the same rule the proof of concept used
(``getColNames.R``: factor columns are the non-numeric ones), but derived from
observed value shapes rather than R's ``is.factor``, so a column of integer
subject IDs read from CSV can still be declared a factor explicitly.

This path is kept first-class — the VS Code extension routes "Plot" on a .csv
file here, with no project and no database — so the standalone claim stays
exercised rather than aspirational.

One inference limit worth knowing: a column of purely numeric IDs (``1, 2, 3``
for subject) is indistinguishable from a measurement by value alone, so it is
classified as a measure. Pass ``factors=["subject", ...]`` — or read it as text
with ``dtype={"subject": str}`` — when that is not what you want. A scidb
source never hits this: it knows which columns are schema keys.
