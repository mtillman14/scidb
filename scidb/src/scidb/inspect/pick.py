"""Interactive record selection: pure drill-down logic over PickCandidates.

Scope guard (plan decision / Phase 6): the picker *selects* a record, it
never displays data — that is the GUI's job. The flow narrows candidates
variable → schema keys → variant, asking only when a level actually
disambiguates (single-valued levels are skipped).

The chooser is injected (``choose(title, labels) -> index``), so this module
has no I/O and is unit-testable with a scripted chooser; the CLI supplies a
stderr-menu/stdin implementation. A future full TUI (textual/prompt_toolkit
behind a ``scidb[tui]`` extra) would replace only the chooser, not this flow.
