"""
Regression test to verify that both Python and MATLAB scidb.for_each() use batch save.

This test ensures that the batch save optimization (20-40x speedup) is actually
being used by both execution paths, and will catch any future regressions that
accidentally revert to sequential row-by-row saving.
