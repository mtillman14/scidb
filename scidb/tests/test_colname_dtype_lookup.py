"""Regression tests for ColName dtype-metadata resolution.

Background (2026-08-25): ``_resolve_colname_from_db`` queried the
``_variables`` table via::

    row = resolved_db._execute(...).fetchone()   # inside try/except Exception

Two defects in one line:

1. ``resolved_db`` is a ``DatabaseManager``, which defines no ``_execute``
   (the method lives on ``SciDuck``, reached via ``._duck``) and has no
   ``__getattr__`` delegation — so this raised ``AttributeError`` every time.
2. The bare ``except Exception: row = None`` swallowed it, silently turning
   "the lookup crashed" into "the variable isn't saved yet". The dtype branch
   below was therefore dead code and the ``view_name()`` fallback was the only
   path ever taken.

Separately, ``_execute(...).fetchone()`` fetches after the lock is released
— see sciduckdb/tests/test_fetch_locking.py.
