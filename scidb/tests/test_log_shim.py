"""Regression: scidb.log must keep re-exporting the scistacklog facade.

MATLAB's +scidb/Log.m delegates via py.scidb.log.Log.*, and many modules
import ``from scidb.log import Log`` — this import path is a public contract
even though the implementation moved to the scistacklog package.

Also pins the level policy contracts that Stage 3 established:
- configure_database writes a run-context header and the log file
- [timing] summaries are INFO (present in the file at the default level);
  the MATLAB timing-archive grep workflow depends on them
- per-record/per-column internals are DEBUG (absent at the default level)
