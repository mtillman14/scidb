"""
Manual built-in/library function references.

Validates a reference to a function the user did NOT write themselves
(e.g. ``numpy.mean``, ``pandas.read_csv``, a Python stdlib call, or a
native MATLAB command like ``mean``) so it can be used as a normal
function node, alongside — never instead of — auto-discovered functions
from the user's own code. Shared by both the FastAPI route
(``api/builtin_functions.py``) and the JSON-RPC handler (``server.py``,
VS Code extension mode).

Python references are restricted to the standard library plus numpy/pandas
(exactly what this feature is scoped to, not a general import backdoor),
and conventional import aliases are accepted and canonicalized —
``pd.read_csv`` is stored as ``pandas.read_csv``. Both rules live in
:mod:`scistack_gui.library_functions`.

MATLAB references are validated by shelling out to a real MATLAB
installation (``matlab -batch "disp(exist(...))"``) since there is no
lightweight way to confirm a MATLAB builtin/toolbox function exists
without one.

**Python and MATLAB references are handled asymmetrically on purpose.**
Both are persisted (see ``pipeline_store.write_builtin_function``) because
neither is rediscovered by scanning disk. But a Python reference is never
put into ``registry._functions``: it is imported on demand at every use
site (:mod:`scistack_gui.library_functions`), so there is nothing to
replay and no refresh path that can evict it. A MATLAB reference has no
import equivalent — it must be re-registered into ``matlab_registry``,
which is what :func:`replay_persisted_builtins` still exists to do.
