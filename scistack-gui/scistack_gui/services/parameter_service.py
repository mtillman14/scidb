"""
Parameter creation and editing — the single source of truth for writing
named ``scidb.Parameter(...)`` declarations to source.

A Parameter is a named thing with one or more values, replacing the former
Constant (one) / Sweep (many) split — see
docs/claude/entity-editability-model.md (D6). One service, because there is
one concept: adding a value is adding an argument, never a change of kind.

A Parameter is source-scanned (see
docs/claude/code-discovery-categories.md), so "create from the GUI" means
appending a real declaration to the configured ``variable_file`` and
refreshing the registry — never writing a bare name to layout.json.

The declaration text is rendered by ``scidb.source_edit.render_parameter``
(Python) / ``matlab_parser.render_matlab_parameter`` (MATLAB), which own the
declaration grammar. :func:`update_parameter` rewrites an existing
declaration in place through ``target_file_service.update_declaration``,
which owns the write policy (entities-file confinement, stale-file guard,
atomic write, rollback).

    An empty *values* writes a Parameter with **no values** — the GUI's "New

    Adding a value is just a longer *values* list — there is no separate

    (D6). An empty *values* is **accepted**: a Parameter's value set may be
    empty at any time, not only at creation, so removing the last value is
    allowed rather than blocked. Values that have already run keep their DB
    history and stay visible on the node as ``history`` rows; a run wired to
    the now-empty Parameter fails loudly at ``for_each`` expansion.

    *group* marks these values as one **generated set** —
    ``{"kind": "range"|"list", "spec": {...}}`` — which is display state
    only: the panel's "Replace values" button sends it, the "Add value"
    button does not, and that is the whole of how the two are told apart.
