Push notifications to the VS Code extension host via stdout.

Replaces ws.py's push_message/broadcast for the JSON-RPC server mode.
In standalone (FastAPI) mode, ws.py is used instead.

All output is newline-delimited JSON on stdout. User code stdout is captured
by redirect_stdout in run.py, so it never leaks into the JSON-RPC stream.
