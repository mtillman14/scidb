"""
Standalone/browser MATLAB sidecar (Stage 3, plan-matlab-pipeline-execution.md).

A lazily-started, kept-warm MATLAB process the Python backend drives
directly over its own stdin/stdout REPL — for environments with no VS Code
+ MathWorks terminal integration (``matlabTerminal.ts``/``dagPanel.ts``,
which handle Tier 2). No new ``.m`` file is needed: MATLAB's own
command-line REPL *is* the "server".

Protocol: a command is wrapped in an outer ``try/catch`` that ALWAYS
``disp``s exactly one sentinel line before returning to the prompt — a
success sentinel on the normal path, an error sentinel (carrying the
caught exception's message) in the catch — regardless of whether the
command text itself already has its own inner try/catch (Stage 1's
generated scripts do; nesting is valid MATLAB and the outer catch also
guards commands with no error handling of their own). ``run_command``
writes the wrapped text, then reads stdout lines from a background reader
thread via a queue until one of the two sentinels appears.

No real MATLAB environment exists in this dev sandbox (see the plan
doc's note) — this module is exercised here only via mocked
``subprocess.Popen``; real verification needs the user's own MATLAB
install.
