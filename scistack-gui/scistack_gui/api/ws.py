WebSocket endpoint: /ws

A WebSocket is a persistent two-way connection between the browser and the
server — unlike HTTP where the browser asks and the server answers once,
a WebSocket stays open so the server can push messages at any time.

We use it here to stream for_each stdout back to the frontend in real time,
and to notify the frontend when the DAG should refresh.

Messages sent to the frontend are JSON objects with a "type" field:
  {"type": "run_output", "run_id": "...", "text": "..."}
  {"type": "run_done",   "run_id": "...", "success": true}
  {"type": "dag_updated"}

Delivery architecture (rewritten 2026-07-18 — the stuck-"Running…" bug):
each connection owns a PER-CLIENT outbox queue and a pump task that reads
ONLY that queue; the pump is explicitly cancelled on disconnect. The old
design shared ONE queue among every pump ever started, and disconnects
leaked their pump (gather doesn't cancel siblings) — so after any
reconnect, an orphaned pump could win the race for a message and consume
it on behalf of a dead connection, silently losing run_done/dag_updated
(regression-tested in tests/test_ws.py::test_push_after_reconnect_...).

Two entry points:
  1. ``broadcast()``   — from ASYNC endpoint handlers; sends directly.
  2. ``push_message()`` — from BACKGROUND RUN THREADS; hops onto the event
     loop via call_soon_threadsafe and fans out to every client's outbox.
Every drop point logs, so a delivery failure can be traced in scidb.log
via the [ws] lines.

Multiple clients are legitimate: the server holds ONE project (db._db is a
module global), so N connections are always N views of the SAME project —
two windows on one pipeline. Each costs a full graph rebuild per mutation,
though, since every client re-fetches on ``dag_updated``.

Connection identity + liveness (2026-08-25): ``client connected (2 total)``
used to be unattributable — there was no way to tell two browser tabs from
one page that had somehow opened two sockets. Each connection now carries a
short id, its peer address, and the ``page_id`` the frontend reports in its
``hello`` frame. **Two connections sharing a page_id are one page** (a
socket leak); different page_ids are genuinely different tabs/windows.

Liveness: the frontend pings every PING_INTERVAL_S. A client that stops
pinging is reaped after CLIENT_SILENT_TIMEOUT_S. Before this, the handler
blocked forever on ``receive_text()`` and the ONLY way a client left
``_clients`` was a proper close frame — so a tab that died uncleanly (crash,
laptop sleep, network drop) stayed registered forever while every fan-out
kept enqueueing into an outbox nobody would ever drain.
