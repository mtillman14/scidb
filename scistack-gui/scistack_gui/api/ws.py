"""
WebSocket endpoint: /ws

A WebSocket is a persistent two-way connection between the browser and the
server — unlike HTTP where the browser asks and the server answers once,
a WebSocket stays open so the server can push messages at any time.

We use it here to stream for_each stdout back to the frontend in real time,
and to notify the frontend when the DAG should refresh.

Messages sent to the frontend are JSON objects with a "type" field:
  {"type": "run_output", "run_id": "...", "text": "..."}
  {"type": "run_done",   "run_id": "...", "success": true}
  {"type": "dag_updated"}
