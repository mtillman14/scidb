"""
Regression tests for the WebSocket push path (api/ws.py).

Background (2026-07-18): runs completed server-side in ~50ms but the GUI
stayed on "Running…" forever — run_output/run_done/dag_updated pushed by
the background run thread never reached the browser, while direct
``broadcast()`` calls from async endpoints did. The thread path
(``push_message`` → call_soon_threadsafe → asyncio queue → ``_pump_queue``)
has several silent drop points; these tests pin its contract:

  a message pushed from a plain background thread while a client is
  connected MUST reach that client.

No DB needed — a minimal FastAPI app with just the ws router.
