"""
A variable type nothing declares must be surfaced early and clearly -- but
not blocked, because Python is not the authority on MATLAB's path.

From scidb.log, 2026-09-01: ``Raw_EMG`` was placed on the canvas at
15:31:58 (``put_layout`` -> ``write_manual_node``, layout only -- nothing
declared it), the command generator warned about it at 15:33:03, and MATLAB
failed at 15:35:02 with ``Unrecognized function or variable 'Raw_EMG'``.

The fix is *visibility*, not refusal, and this module pins both halves:

- placement stays permissive (an undeclared manual node is a designed
  placeholder that graduates later, and paste/duplicate/extract copy them);
- the unresolvable-type answer reaches the run console before MATLAB
  starts, instead of living only in a script comment and a log line.

See ``.claude/plan-entity-surfaces-and-reload-cost.md`` Stage 4.
