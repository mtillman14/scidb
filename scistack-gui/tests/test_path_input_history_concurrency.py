"""Regression test for the concurrent graph-build crash of 2026-08-25.

``GET /path-inputs`` and ``GET /pipeline`` are both sync ``def`` handlers, so
FastAPI runs each on its own threadpool thread against one shared SciDuck
connection. They overlapped by 1ms::

    17:40:54.002  GET /path-inputs        <- thread A, touches the DB
    17:40:54.003  Starting graph build    <- thread B
    17:40:54.028  CRASH in list_path_input_history

``list_path_input_history`` fetched *after* ``_execute`` had released the
lock, so DuckDB tore the pending result down mid-fetch::

    _duckdb.InternalException: INTERNAL Error:
        Attempted to dereference shared_ptr that is NULL!

The static guard lives in sciduckdb/tests/test_fetch_locking.py; this test
exercises the real store functions through real threads.
