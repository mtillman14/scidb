# Input Markers: ColName, PathInput, PathOutput

## Purpose

Three `for_each` input wrappers look similar (each resolves to a string/path at
run time) but play very different roles. This note distinguishes them and
records exactly when and where each is resolved across the scifor and scidb
layers, so they don't get conflated again.

| Marker | Resolves to | When | Reads/writes files? |
|--------|-------------|------|---------------------|
| `ColName` | a **column name** string | static (up front) or per-column | no |
| `PathInput` | an **existing input** file path | per-combo, with filesystem **discovery** | the function *reads* it |
| `PathOutput` | an **output** file path | per-combo + per-column | the function *writes* it |

The one-line mental model: **`ColName` = "which column," `PathInput` = "find the
input file," `PathOutput` = "name the output file."**

## ColName — a column name

Defined in `scifor/src/scifor/colname.py`. scidb re-exports it directly
(`from scifor import ColName`) — there is no scidb-side `ColName` class
anymore (removed during the scifor/scidb modifier-class unification, see
`docs/claude/scifor-scidb-modifier-unification.md`). Two forms:

- `ColName(df)` / `ColName(MyVar)` — **static**. Resolved once, up front, to the
  single non-schema data column name of the DataFrame/variable. Raises if there
  are 0 or 2+ data columns.
- `ColName()` (or the bare class `ColName`) — **deferred**. Resolves per-column
  inside a `for_columns` iteration to the column currently being fed to the
  function. Requires at least one iterate input.

```python
"data_column": scifor.ColName,   # deferred → "intervention", "prepost", ...
```

It is a *resolution marker*, not a real constant — see "Version keys" below.

## PathInput — locate an existing input file

Defined in `scifor/src/scifor/pathinput.py`. Substitutes `{key}` from combo
metadata into a template and resolves it to a real path the function then
**reads**.

**As of the scifor/scidb modifier-class unification** (see
`docs/claude/scifor-scidb-modifier-unification.md`), the discovery/resolution
*orchestration* around `PathInput` lives in **scifor**, not scidb:

- `scifor.foreach.resolve_pathinput_discovery(pi, metadata_iterables,
  user_explicit_keys, log=...)` runs filesystem discovery (via
  `pi.apply_discovery()`), fills empty schema keys from disk, and drops any
  key a fully static (no `{key}` placeholders) `PathInput` can never supply
  instead of leaving it as an empty iterable. Called from scifor's own
  standalone `for_each()` (Step 2.5) **and** from scidb's `_for_each_prepare`
  (its old Step 3 is now a thin call into this function) — one shared
  implementation for both layers.
- Per-combo resolution: bare `PathInput` is classified as a **constant**
  (`_is_data_input` is False, same bucket as `PathOutput`) and resolved via
  `scifor.foreach._resolve_path_inputs`, called right before `_call_fn` and
  inside `_run_column_iteration` — mirroring `_resolve_path_outputs`'s shape
  exactly. Default resolution is `pathinput.load(**metadata)`; scidb injects
  a `_path_input_resolver` override (`_load_pathinput_checked`, schema-key-type
  spelling enforcement) into `scifor.for_each(..., _path_input_resolver=...)`.
- Consequently, `PathInput` is **excluded** from scidb's `_is_loadable` (it
  has a real `.load()` so the old `hasattr(v, "load")` fallback would still
  catch it without an explicit early-out) — a bare `PathInput` is never
  wrapped in `PerComboLoader` anymore. `foreach_config.py`'s
  `_get_direct_constants`/`_serialize_inputs` were updated in lockstep so
  `PathInput.to_key()` still lands in `__inputs` (version-key identity)
  instead of leaking into `__constants` as a raw object.
- The one surviving scidb-side `PerComboLoader` path for `PathInput` is
  `Fixed(PathInput(...))` — scifor's `Fixed` only wraps DataFrames, so a
  loadable spec nested inside `Fixed` still needs scidb's loader.
- `regex=True` matches the last segment against existing files and raises
  `FileNotFoundError` on zero matches (unchanged, in `PathInput.load()` itself).
- zero-padded numeric filenames (`6MWT-001.mat` from `trial=1`) are handled
  natively by a numeric-equivalence fallback in `load()` — see
  `docs/claude/pathinput-zero-padded-matching.md`.
- two placeholders adjacent with no delimiter (`{speed}{trial}`) are
  ambiguous under the default greedy capture; `key_regex` lets a caller
  declare the split explicitly — see `docs/claude/pathinput-key-regex.md`.

All of that is about *finding inputs to read*. Pointing a `PathInput` at an
output path is wrong: discovery finds nothing and regex mode errors.

## PathOutput — name an output file

Defined in `scifor/src/scifor/pathoutput.py`, re-exported as `scidb.PathOutput`.
A **pure output-path template**: no discovery, no regex, no `.load`. It
substitutes two sources via literal `str.replace` (so other braces pass through):

- **combo metadata** — every `{key}` matching a metadata name for the current
  combo (e.g. `{subject}`, `{session}`). Missing keys are left untouched.
- **current column** — the token `{ColName}` becomes the current `for_columns`
  column. Using `{ColName}` requires an iterate input (hard error otherwise).

The result keeps the template's type: `Path` in → `Path` out, `str` in → `str`
out. The function receives a finished path as a plain argument and decides what
to write.

```python
"filename": scifor.PathOutput(root / "{subject}_{ColName}_anova2way.pdf"),
# → root/"1_intervention_anova2way.pdf", root/"1_prepost_anova2way.pdf", ...
```

This is the right home for per-column output filenames. Earlier iterations
overloaded `ColName(template)` for this — reverted, because a column-name marker
shouldn't emit a filesystem path — and `PathInput` is the wrong host because of
its input-discovery baggage above.

## How PathOutput resolves (scifor only)

scidb **delegates the core loop to `scifor.for_each`** (`scidb/foreach.py:437`),
so all `PathOutput` resolution lives in scifor; scidb is transparent to it.

In `scifor/src/scifor/foreach.py`:

1. `PathOutput` is **not** a data input (`_is_data_input` is False) → it lands in
   `constant_inputs`.
2. Guard (Step 6.5 area): a `PathOutput` whose template contains `{ColName}` with
   **no** iterate input raises — mirroring the deferred-`ColName` guard.
   Metadata-only templates are fine without an iterate input.
3. **Non-iterate** combo: `_resolve_path_outputs(filtered_inputs, metadata, None)`
   resolves the template with combo metadata just before `_call_fn`.
4. **for_columns** combo: `_run_column_iteration` (now receiving `metadata`)
   resolves each `PathOutput` per column with `metadata` + the current column.

scidb only re-exports `PathOutput` and (see below) excludes it from version keys.
Because it has no `.load`, is not in `_is_loadable`'s tuple, and is not a
`PathInput`, scidb's discovery/loading never touch it — `_convert_inputs` passes
it through as a constant into `scifor.for_each`, and `state.full_combos` carries
the schema-key metadata it substitutes.

## Version keys: ColName and PathOutput are excluded

`scidb/src/scidb/foreach_config.py` `_get_direct_constants` excludes **both**
`ColName` and `PathOutput`. Reasons:

- They are per-combo/column **resolution markers**, not fixed scalar constants.
- The for_each save path serializes `config_keys` via `json.dumps` **without**
  `default=str` (`scidb/foreach.py:501`); a raw marker object (neither is
  JSON-serializable) would crash it.
- Semantically, an output path is *write bookkeeping*, not computation identity.
  So changing only the output filename does **not** fork the version-key group
  (a re-run reuses/overwrites rather than creating a new variant). If output
  paths ever need to fork variants, this is the line to revisit.

## MATLAB note

The MATLAB bridge serializes a deferred scifor `ColName` as `{"kind":
"colname"}` (`sci-matlab/src/sci_matlab/bridge.py:771`) and rebuilds a bare
`scifor.ColName()` on the other side. `PathOutput` is **not** threaded through
MATLAB yet — a templated output path would not round-trip. Add it there only if
MATLAB pipelines need per-column output filenames.
