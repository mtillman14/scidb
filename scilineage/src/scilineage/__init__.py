"""SciLineage: function-source hashing utilities.

What remains of scilineage after the lineage-wrapper system (``@lineage_fcn`` /
``LineageFcnResult`` / input classification / rerun cache) was removed in favor
of scidb's ``@pipeline`` + bipartite provenance graph: the bytecode/AST-based
function hashing that scidb uses for function identity in the graph.
