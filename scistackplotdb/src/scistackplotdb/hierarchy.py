"""
Schema-depth joins.

Two variables can share a plot only if their schema levels can be joined.
Because the dataset schema is an ordered, contiguous hierarchy (see
``docs/claude/schema-hierarchy-contiguity.md``), a variable's levels are always
a *prefix* of the schema key list — so the join rule is simple and total:

* identical levels  → a straight merge on all of them;
* one a prefix of the other → **broadcast**: the shallower variable's value is
  repeated across every deeper row beneath it (subject-level Mass against
  trial-level Speed);
* otherwise → refuse, and say why.

Answering this question is also what lets the GUI populate its measure list
honestly instead of offering combinations that cannot be built.
